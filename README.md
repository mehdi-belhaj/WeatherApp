- **API**:
	- [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) API to get the current weather for any city.
	- [OpenCage Geocoding](https://opencagedata.com/) API to convert coordinates to and from places.
- **JavaScript**: 
	- `fetch()` to access API.
	- to dynamically modify content on the page & background images.
- **Unsplash**: to get a random background image `https://source.unsplash.com/1600x900/?landscape` ([Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)).
